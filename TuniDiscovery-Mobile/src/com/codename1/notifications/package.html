        <h1>Local Notification API</h1>
        <p>Local notifications are similar to push notifications, except that they are initiated locally by the app, rather than remotely.
          They are useful for communicating information to the user while the app is running in the background, since they manifest
          themselves as pop-up notifications on supported devices.
        </p>

        <h2>Sending Notifications</h2>

        <p>The process for sending a notification is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Create a {@link com.codename1.notifications.LocalNotification} object with the information you want to send in the notification.</li>
          <li>Pass the object to {@link com.codename1.ui.Display#scheduleLocalNotification(LocalNotification,long,int)}.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notifications can either be set up as one-time only or as repeating.</p>

        <h3>Example Sending Notification</h3>
        <pre>
        {@code
        LocalNotification n = new LocalNotification();
        n.setId("demo-notification");
        n.setAlertBody("It's time to take a break and look at me");
        n.setAlertTitle("Break Time!");
        n.setAlertSound("/notification_sound_bells.mp3"); //file name must begin with notification_sound


        Display.getInstance().scheduleLocalNotification(
                n,
                System.currentTimeMillis() + 10 * 1000, // fire date/time
                LocalNotification.REPEAT_MINUTE  // Whether to repeat and what frequency
        );
      }
    </pre>
        <p>The resulting notification will look like </p>

        <h2>Receiving Notifications</h2>

        <p>The API for receiving/handling local notifications is also similar to push.  Your application's main lifecycle class needs
           to implement the {@link com.codename1.notifications.LocalNotificationCallback} interface which includes a single method: {@link com.codename1.notifications.LocalNotificationCallback#notificationReceived(String)}</p>


        <p>The {@literal notificationId } parameter will match the {@literal id} value of the notification as set using
          {@link com.codename1.notifications.LocalNotification#setId(String)}.</p>

        <h3>Example Receiving Notification</h3>
        <pre>
        {@code
        public class BackgroundLocationDemo implements LocalNotificationCallback {
            //...

            public void init(Object context) {
                //...
            }

            public void start() {
                //...

            }

            public void stop() {
                //...
            }

            public void destroy() {
                //...
            }

            public void localNotificationReceived(String notificationId) {
                System.out.println("Received local notification "+notificationId);
            }
        }
       }
     </pre>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> {@link com.codename1.notifications.LocalNotificationCallback#localNotificationReceived(String)}
          is only called when the user responds to the notification by tapping on the alert.  If the user doesn't opt to
          click on the notification, then this event handler will never be fired.</p>

        <h2>Cancelling Notifications</h2>

        <p>Repeating notifications will continue until they are canceled by the app. You can cancel a single notification by calling {@link com.codename1.ui.Display#cancelLocalNotification(String)}</p>

        <p>Where {@literal notificationId} is the string id that was set for the notification using {@link com.codename1.notifications.LocalNotification#setId(String)}.

        <h2>Sample App</h2>

        <p>You can see a full sample that uses the new local notifications API
